            <p>Before I started coding I was a teaching fellow for 2 years at <Anchor text="Teach For Thailand" href="https://www.teachforthailand.org/" /> where I realized my passion is solving problems for people. <br /><br />
            
            Then I started my coding journey at <Anchor text="freeCodeCamp" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" />. My passion drives me to join the Junior Software Developer (Fullstack) Bootcamp by <Anchor text="Generation Thailand" href="https://thailand.generation.org/" />
            , where I learned a lot of technical skills and how to work with others by using agile. <br /><br />

            Nowadays Iâ€™m still fully passionate about developing my technical skills and soft skills every day. I wish I can use creativity to deliver something that is valuable for your organization in the future.</p>
