        Before I started coding I was a teaching fellow for 2 years at{" "}
        <Anchor
          text="Teach For Thailand"
          href="https://www.teachforthailand.org/"
        />{" "}
        where I realized my passion is solving problems for people. <br />
        <br />
        Then I started my coding journey at{" "}
        <Anchor text="freeCodeCamp" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" />. My
        passion drives me to join the Junior Software Developer (Fullstack)
        Bootcamp by{" "}
        <Anchor
          text="Generation Thailand"
          href="https://thailand.generation.org/"
        />
        , where I learned a lot of technical skills and how to work with others
        by using agile. <br />
        <br />
        Nowadays Iâ€™m still fully passionate about developing my technical skills
        and soft skills every day. I wish I can use creativity to deliver
        something that is valuable for your organization in the future.
